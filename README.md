# ✈️ Skills Plane

> **The Global Standard for AI Agent Intelligence.** 

**Skills Plane** is an open-source **Protocol for Agent Capabilities**. It is designed to be the "npm" for intelligence, providing a standardized way for individuals, elite open-source projects, and world-class organizations to publish and distribute their operational standards for AI agents.

## 🌎 The Vision: A World of Shared Intelligence

Imagine a world where your AI agent doesn't just "guess" how to write code or manage a workflow. Instead, it follows the **Linux Kernel C Standard** because you installed it. It follows **Meta's Engineering Principles** or **AirBnB's Style Guide** because they are published as official "Skills".

Skills Plane aims to be the bridge that transfers human institutional knowledge into executable agent logic.

## 🚀 Native Capabilities

- **Intelligence Protocol**: A multi-file standard (`rules/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`) that moves beyond simple prompts.
- **CLI-Native Workflow**: Install capabilities instantly with `npx skills-plane add <slug>`.
- **Enterprise-Grade Governance**: Define `rules/AGENTS.md` to enforce strict behavioral constraints on your agents.
- **GitHub-Synced Truth**: Skills are verified and synced directly from official repositories, ensuring trust and versioning.
- **Open Standards**: Fully open-source and non-commercial. We build for the future of autonomous systems.

## 🛠️ CLI Protocol

Install a capability into your local `.agent/skills` directory:
```bash
npx skills-plane add <slug>
```

Add a custom skill from any GitHub repository:
```bash
npx add-skill <github-url>
```

## 📋 Aviation Compliance

Skills Plane implements aviation-inspired regulatory compliance for AI agent skills:

- **Pilots (Users)**: Verified user profiles required for direct publishing. Unverified submissions enter approval queue.
- **Airports (Platform)**: Comprehensive audit logging for all skill operations. Secure authentication and access controls.
- **Manufacturing (Skills)**: Quality validation ensures skills meet minimum standards (descriptions, content). Approval process for unverified creators.

All skills undergo validation to maintain platform integrity and safety standards.
